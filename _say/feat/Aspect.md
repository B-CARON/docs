In Zaar, aspect is an inflexionnal feature carried by the AUX. Two exceptions are the Inchoative (Inch) and the Resultative (Res) which are associated with the VERB.
### <a name="Aor">`Aor`</a>: aorist

Zaar: The aorist is the default verbal inflexion found in narrations, and in backgrounded contexts. It is not time referenced, and is associated with habitual contexts.

#### Example

- _kóː <b>kə</b> yé wuriː ?//_ "Or how do you see it?"

### <a name="Conc">`Conc`</a>: concomitant

Zaar: In a narration, the concomitant aspect marks a process as a temporal frame for another process: 'when...', 'as soon as... '. The temporal context is given by the second process. 

#### Example

- _<b>myáːnaː</b> tul gìp kìmsə́ < káwây màːʃîn < fi mə́kə́p //_ "We had just entered Kimsə when the motorcycle stopped."

### <a name="Inch">`Inch`</a>: inchoative

Zaar:  The inchoative indicates the beginning of a bounded process, or a change of state. It is expressed by the verbal particle <b>ni</b> (tagged with the relation compound:prt). 

#### Example

- _əndá mə̀ mbǔt <b>ni</b> mə̀ ndà kúʧi //_ "then we lie down and sleep." 

 NB: the verb _mbut_ alone means "to lie".

The combination of the verbs _fi_ "do" and _yi_ "be", with the particle _ni_ is often lexicalized to produce the verbs _fin_ "start doing" and _yin_ "become".

#### Example

- _myàːyi ɗu bôːl < átâ <b>yin</b> góːla =wòpə̌n ǎn ?//_ "When we played football, didn't he become our goal keeper?"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect

Zaar: The imperfect marks an unbounded process or state, seen from the point of view of its unfolding and not as a bounded or completed event. It can be used in any temporal context, past, present or future.

#### Example

- _<b>ʧáː</b> pol =əm á Kámʃâk fáː !//_ "I like Kamshak I do!"

### <a name="ImpIter">`ImpIter`</a>: imperfect iterative

Zaar: The Imperfect Iterative is the combination of the two aspects in one AUX. Only two occurrences are present in the corpus. 

#### Example

- _<b>myàːyi</b> ɗu bôːl < átâ yin góːla =wòpə̌n ǎn ?//_ "When we played football, didn't he become our goal keeper?"

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative

Zaar: The iterative aspect marks the repetition of a process without any temporal reference. It is often used with a habitual meaning. 

#### Example

- _əndá yi ɓan zoːlé =tə //_ "Then he kept teasing him."

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect

Beja: The perfect has a resultative value. The process or state is considered as having an impact on the moment of enunciation or another moment given by the context.

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive

TODO

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Res">`Res`</a>: resultative
